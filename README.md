The Joint Entrance Examination is one of the largest-scale examinations conducted across the nation, wherein, over 10 lakh students compete. To manage such a large database, an efficient and fool-proof framework is a prerequisite. JoSAA, or Joint Seat Allocation Authority is an agency established by the Ministry of Human Resource Development to manage and regulate the admission to 109 tertiary institutes administered by the national government of India.

This project is the description of the background functionality of the registration procedure carried out, once the final round of the JoSAA counselling gets commenced. There are two types of “persons” involved in this system, i.e., the students and the staff of the respective institutes. The student class has the data types giving information about the rank and the category of the students. This helps in determining the branch they would opt for, in the institute of their preference. The total number of seats in a specific branch is also displayed to the students. To finally get enrolled, the students have to pay the fee, that is determined according to the category of the students. There is a person from the teaching staff who is the representative for the JoSAA body from that institute who handles the registration procedure for the students.
